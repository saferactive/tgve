# SaferActive 

TGVE instance. Visit [GH Pages](https://saferactive.github.io/tgve) to see it.

To make the repo self-sustained two datasets have been added in, so if you want to clone this repo just remember that. They are:

* `ksi.csv` (420kb) please see SaferActive project for details about this output. 
* `las-only-code.geojson` (1.2mb) England's Local Authority and District geographies in `.geojson` format.

Both files are available in the repository's first [release](https://github.com/saferactive/tgve/releases/tag/0.1.0) too.
